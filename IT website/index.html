                <h3>Type of hacker?</h3>
                <p>There are three well-known types of hackers in the world of information security: black hats, white hats and grey hats. These colored hat descriptions were born as hackers tried to differentiate themselves and separate the good hackers from the bad.</p>
                <p>Hacking is when someone breaks into a computer system. They usually do this by targeting people using email and website scams or malware, a software that can damage your device or let a hacker in. From banking to shopping, and streaming to social media, people are spending more time than ever online.</p>
